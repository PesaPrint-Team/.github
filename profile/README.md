# Hi there 👋
Welcome to the circus of hilarity and creativity.

<br> 🙋‍♀️ ABOUT US
Hey, folks! Pesaprint's GitHub organization is the place where magic happens, one line of code at a time. We're a quirky bunch of developers, designers, and dreamers, constantly pushing the boundaries of innovation.


<br> 🌈 CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES
Ready to join the party? Well, hold on tight! To access our mind-blowing projects, you'll need a special VIP pass to our enterprise team setup. Don't worry, though – it's just a formality. We promise not to ask for your favorite ice cream flavor... unless it's part of our super-secret authentication process. 🍦

<br> 👩‍💻 USEFUL RESOURCES
Looking for resources to fuel your coding frenzy? Look no further! We've got everything you need right here in our vibrant organization. Our resources are organized into different teams, each with its own flavor of awesome. So grab your virtual toolbelt and get ready to rock 'n' code!

We will be sharing opensource soon. Watch this space.


<br> 🍿 FUN FACTS
Enough with the serious stuff! Let's dive into the juiciest, most delicious tidbits about our team:

 - We love living life on the edge, which is why we deploy on Fridays – because who needs a quiet weekend anyway? 😅
 - Need an energy boost in the morning? Avocados are our go-to breakfast fuel. They say an avocado a day makes the boss your bro – the coding bugs, that is! 🥑
 - Rumor has it, if you dare to delete the database replication setups, you'll unlock the secret promotion level. Proceed with caution, brave soul! ⚠️
 - Stand-ups? Pfft, we take them to a whole new level. Literally. Our team believes in the power of standing on stands during stand-ups. It's a balancing act of productivity and core muscle workout! 🤸‍♀️
 - Our debugging process involves wearing oversized clown shoes and juggling error messages. It's both a spectacle and a workout! 🤹‍♂️
